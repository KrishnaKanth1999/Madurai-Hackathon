A Movie Recommendation Application

#### Data Set Description:

The Data Set consists of details about  various movies,their respective cast,crew members,box office collection and user ratings.

#### Aim of our Application:

The aim of our application is to recommend user similar movies based on the movies they provide us. 

#### Algorithm Used:

In this work we propose a Recommendation Algorithm that takes various factors like movie genre,director name,plot keywords,actors etc 
into account while recommending. We focus on exploring the concept of spatial autocorrelation, i.e., similar values cluster 
together on a map, by using some statistical measures. This work uses a k-d tree based space partitioning technique.
